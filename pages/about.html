            <p>Suzi's Bakeshop is a home bakery where all the baked goods are free! Suzi doesn't bake for the money, she bakes for the love of her friends, family, and colleagues. Her specialties include Peppernuts, Spritz Cookies, Angel Food Cake, and many more! You can find Suzi buying lots of flour and baking many many batches of cookies during the holiday season!</p>
